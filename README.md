# 🌐 Quantum Gates Visualization using Qiskit

This project is a simple interactive Python application built with **Qiskit** that allows users to explore basic **quantum gates** and their effects on quantum states.

Users can select a **Pauli gate**, choose the **number of qubits**, and visualize the results using different quantum representations such as the Bloch Sphere, histograms, and circuits.

## 🚀 Features

- Supports **Pauli Gates**:
  - Pauli-X (X)
  - Pauli-Y (Y)
  - Pauli-Z (Z)

- Supports **multiple qubits**
- Interactive menu-based selection
- Multiple visualization and analysis options

## 📋 Menu Options

After selecting a quantum gate and the number of qubits, the user can choose from the following options:

1. **Bloch Sphere Visualization**  
   Visualizes the quantum state of a single qubit on the Bloch Sphere.

2. **Histogram**  
   Displays the measurement probabilities of the quantum state.

3. **Operator**  
   Shows the matrix representation of the selected quantum gate.

4. **Circuit Visualization**  
   Displays the quantum circuit diagram using Qiskit’s circuit drawer.

5. **Measurement Circuit**  
   Adds measurement operations to the circuit and simulates the measurement output.

6. **Exit**  
   Exits the program.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. Select a **Pauli Gate** (X, Y, or Z)
2. Select the **number of qubits**
3. Choose a **visualization or analysis option**
4. View results
5. Repeat or exit the program
